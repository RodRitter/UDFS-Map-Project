# Installation

# Running the local webserver (optional)
If you have your own local webserver, then you can use that.

First make sure you're in the project root.
- `$ npm install` - This will install the webserver
- `$ http-server` - This will start an instance of the webserver

You should see something like this:
```
Starting up http-server, serving ./
Available on:
  http://192.168.56.1:8080
  http://192.168.0.2:8080
  http://127.0.0.1:8080
Hit CTRL-C to stop the server
```
You can now browse to one of the URL's.
